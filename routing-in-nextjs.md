# Routing in Next.js

Routing is a fundamental part of any web application, allowing users to navigate between different pages and views. In Next.js, routing is handled by the built-in `Link` component, which makes it easy to create dynamic and SEO-friendly URLs for your pages.

## Creating Simple Routes

To create a simple route in Next.js, all you need to do is create a file in the `pages` directory with the name of the route. For example, to create a page at the URL `http://localhost:3000/about`, you would create a file at `pages/about.js`.

Here's an example `pages/about.js` file:

```javascript
function AboutPage() {
  return <h1>About Page</h1>
}

export default AboutPage
```

This file exports a simple component that renders an `h1` element with the text "About Page". When a user navigates to `http://localhost:3000/about`, they will see this page.

## Using the Link Component

Next.js provides a `Link` component that makes it easy to create links between pages. Instead of using the traditional `<a>` tag, you can use the `Link` component to create links that work with Next.js's routing system.

Here's an example of how to use the `Link` component:

```
import Link from 'next/link'

<Link href="/about">
  <a>About Us</a>
</Link>
```

This will create a link that displays as "About Us", but when the user clicks on it, they will be taken to the URL `http://localhost:3000/about`.

## Customizing URLs with Dynamic Routes

Next.js also makes it easy to create dynamic routes that can accept parameters. For example, you might want to create a page that displays information about a specific product, with a URL like `http://localhost:3000/products/123`.

To create a dynamic route in Next.js, you can use square brackets in the file name to indicate which part of the URL is dynamic. For example, to create a dynamic route at `http://localhost:3000/products/[id]`, you would create a file at `pages/products/[id].js`.

Here's an example `pages/products/[id].js` file:

```
function ProductPage({ id }) {
  return <h1>Product {id}</h1>
}

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { params } = context
  const id = params.id
  return { props: { id } }
}

export default ProductPage
```

The `getServerSideProps` function is used to fetch data for the page. In this case, we're using the `params` object to extract the `id` parameter from the URL. When a user navigates to `http://localhost:3000/products/123`, they will see a page with the text "Product 123".

To create a link to a dynamic route, you can use the `Link` component with an object that contains the dynamic parameter. For example:

```
<Link href="/products/[id]" as="/products/123">
  <a>Product 123</a>
</Link>
```
This will create a link that displays as "Product 123", but when the user clicks on it, they will be taken to the dynamic URL `http://localhost:3000/products/[id]` with the `id` parameter set to `123`.

## Nested Routes

Next.js also supports nested routes, which allow you to create pages with more complex URLs. For example, you might want to create a page that displays information about a specific category of products, with a URL like `http://localhost:3000/products/electronics/123`.

To create a nested route in Next.js, you can use multiple square brackets in the file name to indicate the different dynamic parameters. For example, to create a nested route at `http://localhost:3000/products/[category]/[id]`, you would create a file at `pages/products/[category]/[id].js`.

Here's an example `pages/products/[category]/[id].js` file:

```
function ProductPage({ category, id }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Category: {category}</h1>
      <h2>Product: {id}</h2>
    </>
  )
}

export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  const { params } = context
  const category = params.category
  const id = params.id
  return { props: { category, id } }
}

export default ProductPage
```

When a user navigates to `http://localhost:3000/products/electronics/123`, they will see a page with the text "Category: electronics" and "Product: 123".

To create a link to a nested route, you can use the `Link` component with an object that contains both dynamic parameters. For example:

```
<Link href="/products/[category]/[id]" as="/products/electronics/123">
  <a>Electronics Product 123</a>
</Link>
```

This will create a link that displays as "Electronics Product 123", but when the user clicks on it, they will be taken to the nested URL `http://localhost:3000/products/[category]/[id]` with the `category` parameter set to `electronics` and the `id` parameter set to `123`.

## Conclusion

Routing is an essential part of any web application, and Next.js provides a powerful and flexible system for handling it. With Next.js, you can create simple static routes, dynamic routes with parameters, and even nested routes with multiple parameters. By using the `Link` component and the `getServerSideProps` function, you can create dynamic and SEO-friendly URLs that make it easy for users to navigate your site.

In this blog post, we've covered the basics of routing in Next.js, including creating simple routes, using the `Link` component, customizing URLs with dynamic routes, and creating nested routes. With this knowledge, you should be able to create robust and flexible routing systems for your Next.js applications.
